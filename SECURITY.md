# LabPilot Security Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the LabPilot laboratory analysis platform to ensure production-ready security.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Input Sanitization Middleware** (`server/middleware/security.ts`)
- Comprehensive XSS prevention using DOMPurify and XSS library
- Deep sanitization of request body, query parameters, and URL parameters
- HTML tag stripping and JavaScript injection prevention

### 2. Authentication and Authorization Security

**Enhanced Authentication** (`server/middleware/auth.ts`)
- Bcrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds

### 6. CSRF Protection

**Custom CSRF Implementation** (`server/middleware/csrf.ts`)
- Double submit cookie pattern
- HMAC-based token generation
- Timing-safe token comparison
- Origin and referer header validation
- Session-based secret management
- User-Agent consistency checking

### 7. SQL Injection Prevention

**Database Security**
- Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries
- Type-safe database operations
- Input sanitization before database operations
- NoSQL injection protection (for query parameters)
- Connection security with environment validation

### 8. Error Handling and Information Disclosure Prevention

**Secure Error Handling** (`server/middleware/errorHandler.ts`)
- Sanitized error messages in production
- Sensitive data pattern removal from error output
- Environment-specific error detail levels
- Error logging with security event tracking
- Database connection string protection
- Stack trace sanitization

### 9. Security Monitoring and Audit Logging

**Security Logging** (`server/middleware/security.ts`)
- Suspicious activity pattern detection
- Request/response monitoring
- Slow request detection
- Security event audit trails
- Authentication event logging
- File operation logging

**Audit Trail**
- User action logging
- Security event recording
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Timestamp and context preservation
- Database-stored audit logs

### 10. Production Environment Security

**Environment Validation** (`server/middleware/security.ts`)
- Required environment variable validation
- Session secret strength enforcement
- Database URL format validation
- Production-specific security configurations
- Startup security checks

**Production Security Configuration**
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure cookie settings
- CSP enforcement
- HSTS header implementation
- Security header optimization

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Required for production
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=<32+ character secure random string>
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql connection string>
FRONTEND_URL=<https://your-domain.com>

# Optional security configuration
COOKIE_SECRET=<secure random string>
CSRF_SECRET=<secure random string>
```

### Security Middleware Stack

The security middleware is applied in the following order:

2. **Security Logger** - Logs suspicious activity and performance issues
3. **Security Headers** - Sets comprehensive security headers
4. **Helmet** - Additional security headers and CSP
5. **HPP Protection** - HTTP Parameter Pollution prevention
6. **NoSQL Sanitizer** - Query parameter injection prevention
7. **CORS** - Cross-origin request validation
8. **Rate Limiting** - Endpoint-specific rate limiting
9. **Cookie Parser** - Secure cookie parsing
10. **Body Parsing** - Request body parsing with size limits
11. **Input Sanitization** - XSS and injection prevention
12. **Session Management** - Secure session handling
13. **CSRF Protection** - Cross-site request forgery prevention

### API Endpoint Security

All API endpoints include:

- Authentication requirement (`requireAuth` middleware)

- XSS injection attempts (`<script>`, `javascript:`)
- SQL injection attempts (`union select`, etc.)
- Rate limit violations
- Authentication failures
- File upload abuse
- CSRF token violations

### Security Event Logging

All security events are logged with:

- Timestamp
- IP address
- User agent
- Request details
- Security violation type
- User information (if authenticated)

### Incident Response Process

1. **Detection** - Automated security monitoring
2. **Logging** - Comprehensive event logging
3. **Analysis** - Log analysis and threat assessment
4. **Response** - Account lockout, IP blocking, or other measures
